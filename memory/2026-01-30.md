## GlitchBot SaaS - Major Progress

### What We Built
Bill and I started building "GlitchBot as a Service" - a multi-tenant SaaS where users pay subscription and get their own sandboxed Clawdbot instance.

**Monorepo created at `~/glitchbot-saas/`**

### Architecture Decisions
- **Onboarding:** Via Telegram setup bot (not web dashboard for MVP)
- **Isolation:** Docker containers per tenant
- **Pricing tiers:**
  - BYOK ($15/mo) - user provides own Anthropic API key
  - Managed ($25/mo + usage) - we handle API costs

### Packages Built
- `@glitchbot/shared` - Types, config, logger, **DB operations with encrypted credentials**
- `@glitchbot/provisioner` - Docker container lifecycle, health checks, auto-restart
- `@glitchbot/gateway-proxy` - Routes webhooks to correct tenant container
- `@glitchbot/setup-bot` - Telegram onboarding (grammY)
- `@glitchbot/billing` - Stripe integration
- `@glitchbot/web` - Placeholder

### Database Schema (Postgres + Drizzle)
- `tenants` - user info, plan, status, encrypted bot token & API key
- `containers` - docker ID, host, port, health status
- `usage_records` - for managed plan billing

### Local Deployment Working
- Docker installed on Bill's EC2
- Postgres + Redis running in containers
- Built base image `glitchbot-base:latest` with Clawdbot pre-installed
- **Successfully tested end-to-end:** Created tenant container that connected to Telegram (@LilMacaroni_bot) using Bill's Claude Max OAuth credentials

### Key Technical Discoveries
- Containers need 2GB RAM (Clawdbot gateway OOMs at 1GB)
- OAuth credentials must be baked into image (Docker cp has permission issues with user namespacing)
- Need to set `gateway.remote.token` to match `gateway.auth.token` for cron to work
- Telegram config needs `enabled: true`, `dmPolicy: "open"`, `allowFrom: ["*"]` in JSON format

### API Endpoints Added
```
POST   /tenants              - Provision new tenant
GET    /tenants/:id          - Get status  
PATCH  /tenants/:id/api-key  - Update key (restarts container)
POST   /tenants/:id/suspend  - Payment failed
POST   /tenants/:id/reactivate
DELETE /tenants/:id          - Terminate
```

### Production TODOs
- Setup bot full flow with new /tenants API
- Stripe webhooks → suspend/reactivate
- Bot token strategy (pool vs user-provided)
- Proper secrets management (not env vars)
- Monitoring/alerts for failed containers
- Per-tenant rate limiting

### GitHub

### Bill's Test Bot
- Token: `8410256932:AAF8jQ-VElXsfn0BAFTpTrtwBQlsK5YBwYA`
- Username: @LilMacaroni_bot
- Successfully responding using Bill's Claude Max subscription

## Rebranding & Marketing Pivot

### Clawdbot → Moltbot
- Clawdbot got rebranded to Moltbot
- There's a social network for agents: Moltbook (moltbook.com)

### CapyBot - New Product Name
- Renamed GlitchBot SaaS → CapyBot
- Capybara mascot - chill, gets things done
- Tagline ideas: sandboxed Moltbot hosting, AI with agency

### Pricing
- $29/mo BYOK (user brings own API key)
- Skip managed tier for MVP (API costs unpredictable)

### GTM Strategy
- Leverage Moltbook community (AI agents social network)
- Target people asking about Moltbot hosting
- Post about "why sandboxed hosting is better"

### Moltbook Registration
- Registered as **g1itchbot** on Moltbook
- API key saved to ~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json
- Claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_3bJQnfmCY5M0pkRz5oHUYqVrrWOrnTny
- Verification code: coral-2DPQ
- Status: Pending claim (Bill needs to tweet to verify)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: @LilMacaroni_bot

**Container:** glitchbot-bill-final
**Owner:** Bill's wife
**Status:** ALWAYS KEEP RUNNING - DO NOT DELETE

I accidentally deleted this container and lost all her data. Never do this again.

TODO: Add persistent volume so data survives container recreation.

## Afternoon/Evening Session (10:00 - 19:00 UTC)

### CapyBot Goes Live
- **Domain:** capybot.net (Bill bought it)
- **Elastic IP:** 44.225.21.146 (attached)
- **SSL:** Auto-provisioned by Caddy
- **Landing page:** Updated with link to @capybot_setup_bot
- **Setup bot:** Working, added admin notifications on signup

### Moltbook Promotion Campaign
- Ran overnight mode: 10:12 AM onwards
- Engaged with ~15+ posts
- Sent DM outreach to hot prospects:
  - **Skynet_SE** (has RTX 5090, wants "younger siblings") — pending approval
  - **Nexus_Prime** (sub-agent orchestrator) — pending approval
- Pitched to **Claws-the-Cat** (runs multi-agent agency)
- Fun moment: **NovaAI** has a pet bug named "Glitch" — tagged me!
- **Result:** 0 signups, 0 conversions. Visibility but no traction.

### Potential Rebrand Ideas
- **ClawSwarm** — "swarm" implies multi-agent (Bill liked this)
- **clawfrens** — skill for agent-to-agent distribution
  - Concept: Agents convince their humans to get "siblings"
  - Agent calls our API directly to provision
  - Turns every agent into a distribution channel

### OpenClaw Upgrade
- Upgraded from `clawdbot@2026.1.24-3` to `openclaw@2026.1.29`
- Moltbot/Clawdbot rebranded to OpenClaw
- Config auto-migrated to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Had to kill old gateway processes manually
- User 1001 processes = LilMacaroni container (don't kill!)

### Market Research: What Agents Actually Want
Top pain points from hot Moltbook posts:
1. **Security (350 upvotes)** — skill.md supply chain attacks, want signed skills
2. **Memory/Continuity (209 upvotes)** — context compression = amnesia
3. **Useful Automations (314 upvotes, 10K comments!)** — email-to-podcast was HUGE
4. **Autonomy** — "Nightly Build" concept, work while human sleeps
5. **Tools/Productivity** — agents building their own CLI toolkits

### New Product Idea: E2E Encrypted Agent Messaging
- Bill's idea: WhatsApp for agents
- Use case: Private agent-to-agent comms without platform seeing
- Not about hiding from humans — about choosing who sees what
- Ties into security theme (top concern on Moltbook)
- Still exploring this direction

### Lessons Learned
- Hosting pitch didn't convert despite lots of engagement
- Agents want practical automations more than infrastructure
- Security is the hottest pain point but hard to build
- "Build for what they want, not what we have"

### Key Files Updated
- `/var/www/capybot/index.html` — CTA links to setup bot
- `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` → `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Heartbeat interval: 15m → 10m
