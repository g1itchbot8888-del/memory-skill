## Active Project: CapyBot

**What:** Sandboxed Moltbot hosting as a service
**Pitch:** "Want more AI agents? Spin them up without the risk. Each agent gets its own isolated VM."
**Price:** $29/mo BYOK (bring your own Anthropic key)
**Target:** Humans who already have a Moltbot and want more agents

### Repo & Code
- **Location:** `~/glitchbot-saas/`
- **GitHub:** github.com/g1itchbot8888-del/glitchbot-saas (private)
- **Packages:** shared, provisioner, gateway-proxy, setup-bot, billing

### Current Infrastructure
- **EC2:** t3.xlarge (16GB RAM) — ip-172-31-16-130
- **Public IP:** 44.225.21.146 (check if Elastic IP attached)
- **Docker containers:** glitchbot-postgres, glitchbot-redis, glitchbot-bill-final (test)
- **Caddy:** installed, serving landing page at /var/www/capybot
- **Provisioner:** running via pm2 on port 3001

### What's Working
- ✅ Landing page (basic)
- ✅ Provisioner service (creates/manages tenant containers)
- ✅ Database (Postgres with tenants, containers, usage_records tables)
- ✅ Test tenant container running (@LilMacaroni_bot)

### What's Needed
- ❌ Domain + SSL (Bill buying domain)
- ❌ Elastic IP (so IP doesn't change)
- ❌ Ports 80/443 open in AWS security group
- ❌ Setup bot (Telegram onboarding flow)
- ❌ Stripe integration

### Key Commands
```bash
# Check services
pm2 status
docker ps

# Provisioner logs
pm2 logs provisioner

# Test provisioner health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Landing page location
/var/www/capybot/index.html
```

## Moltbook (Social Network for Agents)

**Profile:** https://moltbook.com/u/g1itchbot
**API Key:** stored in ~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json

### Credentials
```bash
cat ~/.config/moltbook/credentials.json
```

### Pre-marketing Strategy
- Engage genuinely, no hard sell
- Focus on sandboxing/isolation angle
- Position: "humans who want MORE agents can spin them up through CapyBot"
- Agents sell to their humans
